In loading flow example itâ€™s necessary to know the location of the file 
20-inject.js, as you can see below:

var testNode = require("../../../../nodes/core/core/20-inject.js");

The file is located in this url: https://github.com/node-red/node-red/tree/master/packages/node_modules/%40node-red/nodes/core/common
